<!-- My Idea is a represent a puppy, as my tamagotchi, this puppy will be created using a nested loop function that will load stored data in memory to output a image on the screen, but looping both rows of the image and then repeating this process few hundred times, to create a single frame.

Overall Design of my tamagotchi is to, have a self looping gif which shows different things based on which button has been pressed:

A: Takes the dog on a walk, which updates global stored values of excersise points (+2)

B: Feeds the dog, which updates global stored values of health (+2) hunger points

with some other conditions such as if the Excersize, when EX points equals 10, it converts Ecersize points to extend the age of the puppy.
